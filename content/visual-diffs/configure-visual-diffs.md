## Prerequisite: Use Base Previews

In order to configure Tugboat's visual diffs, you must be using at least one
[Base Preview](/building-a-preview/work-with-base-previews/). For more info, see:
[How Visual Diffs work](../using-visual-diffs/).

{{% notice tier %}} This feature is available for [Tugboat Plus and Premium plans](https://www.tugboat.qa/pricing). If
you'd like to run visual diffs on your Tugboat Previews, but you're on a different tier, you'll need to upgrade your
project.{{% /notice %}}
